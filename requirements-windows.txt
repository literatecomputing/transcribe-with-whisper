# Notes:
# - Build the Windows bundle on Windows with these installed in the build venv so
#   PyInstaller captures the packages into the one-dir artifact.
# - If you create separate CI jobs, use requirements-amd64.txt for linux/amd64 docker
#   images and requirements-arm64.txt for Apple silicon or ARM64 images.
