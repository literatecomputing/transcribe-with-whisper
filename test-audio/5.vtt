00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.560
The unique part is how it all fits together.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.480
It's not just using a powerful model

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
like say, faster whisper for the accuracy.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.760
It intelligently bundles that with other vital things,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.480
like speaker separation, knowing who spoke when,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.360
and making sure the output plays nice

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.640
with research software or analytical tools.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.400
Think beyond just basic text.
