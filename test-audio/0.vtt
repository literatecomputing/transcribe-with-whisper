in the modern tech landscape.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.600
How do you get really good AI transcription,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.040
fast, accurate, but crucially,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.080
without sending potentially sensitive stuff,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.160
audio video up to some third party cloud service?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.560

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.240

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.800
It's all about self-hosting.
