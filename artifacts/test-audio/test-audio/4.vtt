Hmm, that is ambitious.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680
Especially with AI tools,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.080
they often have these really complex dependencies, right?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.120
So does the documentation actually show they pulled it off,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.120
hiding the complexity while, you know,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.960
keeping that privacy promise for the data?
