### Stuff on the radar

- Dedoose timestamps (I tihnk it was `#HH:MM:SS.xxx#`)
- choose Whisper Model (currently "base")
- more flexible/arbitrary timestamps
- template for fully customizable output template
- web interface: show items being processed
- web interface: Mark items to be processed
- have processing queue (potential to have processed by more powerful CPU/GPU)
