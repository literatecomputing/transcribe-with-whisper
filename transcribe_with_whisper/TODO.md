### Stuff on the radar

- Dedoose timestamps (I tihnk it was `#HH:MM:SS.xxx#`)
- choose Whisper Model (currently "base")
- more flexible/arbitrary timestamps
- template for fully customizable output template
- web interface: show items being processed
- web interface: Mark items to be processed
- have processing queue (potential to have processed by more powerful CPU/GPU)
- move speakers into HTML (not in basename/basename-speakers.json)
- add initial transcription data to html (and persist after additional runs)
- figure out when macOS can get pyannote-audio 4.0.0
- tweak language on file list
  - Process button should know if there's a reason to run
  - hide/gray re-run if there's no reason to run again now
